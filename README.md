Welcome to your very own Trigger Card

In order to make one yourself, follow the instructions below

In your terminal

1. CD into the backend at 'trigger-card-api'.
2. Enter 'bundle install' (to install necessary gems)
3. Enter 'rails db:migrate' (to migrate the necessary databases)
4. Enter 'rails db:seed' (to seed the some example data for the three categories.)
5. Enter 'rails s' to get the server up and running (it will be running on http://localhost:3001/)
6. Open a new terminal (for app to work, one terminal has to be running the server on the rails side)
7. CD into the frontent at 'frontend-trigger-card-client'.
8. Run 'yarn start' which should prompt to open a window at http://localhost:3000, otherwise copy and paste this into browser of your choice
9. Enjoy making the trigger card, and having it be a mindfulness tool and hope it can help you cope with the world around you
